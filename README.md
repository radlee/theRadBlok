Online platform for Thought Expression

## Description

There is no propepr description of the Blog as yet. But the general idea is to have an online platform where one can write about everything. 
The actual idea is coming from having a diary that will never be lost and will always be clean over the years. The good thing abot this is that 
you can also delete and/or edit your posts.
